#TrainerX
TrainerX its a GTA:SA / SA:MP cheat created for study proposes, with this trainer you can set the player health, armor and money.

####Which type of cheat it has?
The new version (2.0) has a new GUI (Graphical User Interface), I created it by using the Windows Forms aplication thats a way simple than using Win32API, but the idea was to give the user a clean UI.
About the cheats it has `Health,Armor and Money` but it also has a costumization side which lets you costumize the health bar color (this was a head trouble for me). In the future versions I will add more cheats and some costumization as well so stay tune.

####How to use it
After you compiled it you will need to open the GTA and then the program.
If your antivirus acuse's your program has a virus don't panic. 

####Add more functions

To add new functions you will need to do two things:
  - Create the visual form and/or add a new item to the combox;
  - Get the address that you wan't to change, if you are using dynamic address make sure you do [this](https://github.com/RebeloX/TrainerX/issues/7) way

Then you just need to pull a request.

####How did you get the address's?
To get the address's you can use Cheat Engine but if you are to lazy you can check [this list of Memory Address](http://www.gtamodding.com/?title=Memory_Addresses_(SA) ) it has all the GTA SA address's, but be careful you may crash the game so make sure you are using the right address.

####Can I Contribute?
Yes you can, just fork and pull a request, you're welcome.

####Code organization

I'm a bit lazzy so that's why the code has some organization problems but I will organize it later on.
